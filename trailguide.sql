(1, 4, 3, 'Hi there, Ghorepani-Poonhill is extremely accessible as a beginner friendly trek and virtually no risk of high altitude sickness due to its lower elevation.\r\n\r\nEnd of February is ideal due to late Winter and Early Spring weather. The temperature wouldn&#039;t be too low but still cold paired with clear weather (generally). This time also attracts fairly low no. of trekkers so less crowd and more peaceful trails. Your general itinerary could look like this:\r\n\r\nDay 1 - Pokhara to Ghandruk via Jeep or Bus Day 2 - Ghandruk to Tadhapani Day 3 - Tadhapani to Ghorepani Day 4 - Early morning hike to Poonhill and Trek to Banthati after Breakfast and Jeep out to Pokhara Day 5 - Exploration Day at Pokhara Day 6 - Pokhara to Kathmandu via Flight or Tourist Bus Day 7 - Fly out from Kathmandu\r\n\r\nHowever, this itinerary can be done from other way around which makes sense if you want to trek to Chomrong and Jhinu Hot Springs. Only ACAP permit is required which is available from Nepal Tourism Board Office Pokhara or Kathmandu. The itinerary that I have shared doesn&#039;t include traversing over Suspension bridge so you can rest easy on this one. For cost, it might fall on the range of 300 USD including:\r\n\r\nACAP Fees\r\n\r\nGuide and (1) Porter Fees for 4 days\r\n\r\nPrivate Jeep Transportation from Pokhara to Ghandruk and Banthati to Pokhara\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned cost doesn&#039;t include Food and Accomodation and what you calculated makes sense for average cost per meal.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are options to extend the trek upto Mohare Danda - Nangi - Baskharka which can have additional 3-4 days for the existing trek and have more chances of viewing the mountains. Also, instead of ending at Ghorepani-Banthati, we can deviate towards Tatopani and actually recover on the hotsprings over there and travel back to Pokhara.\r\n\r\nHope it helps for your planning. On the end, porter/guide would be less experienced than your Guide for the guiding related services with limited or no knowledge of Wilderness First Aid, Risk Management, Communication Barrier, etc and hence the low prices as Porter/Guide would be on your aid to carry your luggage and navigation only.', 0),
(2, 1, 6, 'Thank you for your response and tips.  I am thinking Poon Hill trek 4 Days / 3 nights.  I have a 50L bag. Is it too big ? https://www.llbean.ca/shop/Mens-L.L.Bean-Ridge-Runner-Backpack-50L/127647.html it isnt water proof though, is that a problem? I seen videos of those ppl trekking this circuit, their bag seems a lot smaller looks slightly bigger than a backpack, except the guide. The guide’s bag is usually very very big / fat like x3 times fatter, like round. Is bringing a big bag 50L bad idea ?  I thought can take a public bus from Pokhara to Nayapan / near Birethani. 500 ruppes (both, the guide could get us local price). Am still thinking atm, just the guide and me, no need to get a jeep. I need someone who will be chatty or I could be bored. I saw random video …of trekking hiking through nepalese villages, the local nepalese rural villages can speak foreign lanngagues like Korean language, Malaysia, other Asian/South East Asian/ Middle East etc… I was a bit surprised. Then they said they previously worked in those countries for several years, learnt the language, and came back to Nepal. They did not explain why they came back to Nepal, maybe working visa expired, they earned enough money, come back home, get married settled down in Nepal, maybe due to covid, borders shut, many had to return back to their country, etc….is it easy to find a Guide who has travelled overseas and worked in a foreign country, understand foreign culture, a broader cultural expose ….who we have more stuffs to talk about, more similar interests etc… rather than just a Guide who has never been out of Nepal, sure I wanna know about Nepali culture, history, traditions, but might be also easier if they can easily be the bridge, help me to relate to Nepal better. Are these Guide with overseas exposure quite rare ?  Go clockwise… then do a short detour to Jhinu Hot Spring on the last day, I saw its a small pool, but not crowded, a short dip/ breaktime. I saw the other one, Tatopani, bigger, can get crowded, popular with locals too, saw people travelling there by bus. Do they trek back to Nayapan or they go to Ghandruk, take the bus back to Pokhara ? Because its going down hill….Jhinun Hot Spring to Nayapan, doubt there will be any nice views ? Might as well go to Ghandruk take the bus back to Pokhara ? Am I right ?  Do you have a sample packing list for the trek ? It is not going to snow right/ice. You dont need any ice shoes right ? I wonder if can fit everything in a Jansport backpack. I been told those lodges will not have heating in the room, there might be a fire place in the common area, bring more winter clothings. Is a sleeping bag recommended ? I do want a hiking stick, do I need two (right and left, i think i saw video, most ppl just use one, maybe the other hand for camera), or just one will do…i saw one in my local shop very expensive during sale….equivalent to 15,000 rupees 😱, i also saw there are traditional Nepali stick, do tourist use them ? If I need to buy hiking gears,….is it better to buy/rent in Katmandu (Thamel) or buy/rent in from Pokhara …  In February is leeches a problem?  I was checking prices of booking.com for accomodation. It seems booking accomodation far ahead of time Feb 2025 cost more…. I checked that even booking for peak season (October) accomodation pokhara is cheaper than booking off peak season Feb 2025. Feb 2025 is x2-x3 price. Does it mean its better to just turn up…. and do last minute booking for accomodation ? Off peak season, probably could get cheaper prices.  What do you think about Mardi Himal compared to Poon Hill ?', 1),

I am a solo teen traveler and would prefer a guide and porter as I don&#039;t have high altitude experience despite being fit. I have contacted a few trekking companies online that offer group packages. Time is not an issue, if I need to stay an extra day to acclimatize, I can. My fear with a group is that timelines must be more strictly followed and there is a possibility my trek cancelled if I need an extra day. Is this typically the case? What do you recommend? Thank you.', 0, ''),

(4, 6, 'Hello. I starting to think/ plan for a solo trip to nepal. Budget traveller, i was thinking off season ….maybe February middle or should i aim for end Feb? Is it too cold ? I saw some youtube videos they did not say when in Feb… but it seems sunny, no snow…saw some ppl…hiking in T-shirt, they walking alot/exercising. I wonder if its because of global warming, winter gets shorter… i am trying to avoid March Holi, crowd…i saw some videos of peak season travelling, you need to wait and queue to take photos at the mountains…lol. That’s too many people for me. I was also hoping off season, maybe can be cheaper. So you think it wont be too crowded in Feb middle or Feb end ?\r\n\r\nAh i forgot to say, i am not going everest. At the moment, I only thinking of Kathamandu fly in, then to Pokhara. I am not sure what else is there, worthy to see or do. I am looking about 7 days or so in Nepal, not too long. Hoping it will be closeby.\r\n\r\nI am thinking of doing an easy trek for beginners. I did some hiking…but nothing too serious. The highest mountain I climb was only 1300m Mt Wellington. So an amateur at trekking. I am thinking to do Poon hill trek. Does all Poon Hill trek includes Jhinu Hot Springs ?\r\n\r\nI dont understand the price. I was thinking just an English speaking guide, no need porter. Is 4 days 3 nights recommended or 5 days 4 nights poon hill trek ? Does 5 days means…. More resting? Or different route ? I read the price of a guide is about USD $25-USD $30 per day. 4 days will be about USD $120. Then I heard usually accomodation is free, if you dine in. I saw the food is about 500 rupees per meal, dal bhat is more expensive at 780 rupees per meal. 500 rupees x 4 days x 2 people ( i assume you pay the guide’s meal as well) x 3 meals per day =12,000 rupees or USD $90. TIM card for solo trekker is 2,000 rupees or USD $15. Entrance fee to Annapurna 3000 rupees or USD 23. That’s $250…the you add aditional stuffs like transport, hot water, water, etc… am I missing anything ? The price seems vastly different from online quotes. I am talking more about the actual “trekking” costs itself…of course need to have the right gears, clothings, medications etc… The guide will have first aid kit ?\r\n\r\nDo people need to aclimitize for Poon Hill trek like….stay in Pokhara before the hike ? I dont anyone doing that…Pokhara is only 822m.\r\n\r\nWhy is the price of the porter-guide cheaper than a guide ? Thought a porter-guide is someone who will do both carry your bag and guide/talk/show you the way. Twice the job, but less money. How does a porter-guide carry your bag ? What about his own bag ?\r\n\r\nI heard about a lake in Pokhara, so I will go see that. I think sunset time. I am not doing paragliding, afraid of heights…. So, there is probably suspension bridges, how do your past clients afraid of height deal with that ? I was thinking ask the guide to walk in front, no sudden shaking, i will remove my prescription glasses and just follow him from behind, dont look down, 🫣.\r\n\r\nAny hidden gems or other interesting spots to explore ? Although I know it cant be guaranteed, but it will be really disappointing to hike 4 days in misty weather and cant see good views, or if it rains, i hope the weather will be decent in February. If its very cloudy, cant see a thing in Poon Hill, i dont want to move ….any options to be flexible and stay longer until I see some epic views ? Why do ppl move on so quickly to the next ….town, why dont ppl stay at one of the hotels/lodges and enjoy the views, recuperate. Which is why I thought Jhinu Hot Spring could be a good spot to relax a bit and recover.\r\n\r\nMany thanks', 0, ''),
